# dimer_paper_visualization
There are hundreds of combinations of molecular dimers. Before I got lost in the piles of papers describing these dimers, I made this script to help me draw the matrix of dimer combinations. You can add brief literature information, labeled by your BibTeX key, to the database, and visualize it. Driven by sqlite3 &amp; PyQt5.
